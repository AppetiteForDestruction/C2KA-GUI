# GUI to Assist the C2KA TOOL

This project consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) to assist the C2KA tool (developed by Dr. Jason Jaskolka). With simple entries, the GUI can generate a text file describing an agent’s specification.  

## Getting Started
1.	Download entire project folder (found at https://github.com/DylanLeveille/C2KA-GUI). 
2.	Open a python IDE (using a version of Python 3.6).
3.	Run the main program by compiling the gui.py file in the IDE.

Note: Steps 2 and 3 may be skipped by starting the executable found in the project folder (Not yet implemented). 

### Prerequisites *(ideas borrowed from Dr. Bailey's course outline for SYSC 1005)

All the software used in this project is free. Here's what you need to install this software on your own computer:

● Python 3.6.2 can be downloaded from: python.org/downloads/release/python-362. For Windows platforms, download the Windows x86-64 executable installer: python-3.6.2-amd64.exe. 

● Wing 101 v. 6.0.7-1 can be downloaded from: wingware.com. Please ensure that you download and install Wing 101, not Wing Professional. The latter IDE has a free 30-day trial license, after which a license must be purchased. Wing 101 is free, and does not require you to purchase a license. For Windows platforms, download the 32-bit/64-bit installer (wingide-101-6.0.7-1.exe). 

Note: as of Version 6.0, Wing Personal is free. This IDE has more features than Wing 101, but fewer than Wing Professional.

### Installing

To install the software correctly, install python, followed by Wing 101. 

Please note there are known issues with OS X, Python's Tkinter module and the third-party Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit on which it depends (these issues are documented at python.org). This should, however, not be an issue for this project.
